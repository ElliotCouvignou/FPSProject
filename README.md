# FPSProject

Developed with Unreal Engine 5.0EA+ by:
- Elliot Couvignou (Programmer)
 

This is a multiplayer FPS project focused on offering fast paced, high skill movement similar to games like TF|2, Quake, etc. Main movement feature is through the ODM grapple hooks inspired by the Attack on Titan anime. Other future features like wallriding and sliding are to be implemented  only if they complement gameplay. 

My goal with this project is to release a FFA/TDM mode with basic "arcade-ish" gunplay and cool/fast movement. 


Implemented Features:
- ODM grapple hooks: fully funcitonal and very fun!
- Abilities, Shooting/damage logic (no recoil)

WIP Features:
- Recoil system (not some simple +x to pitch)
- Steam Lobby
- GameMode Logic
